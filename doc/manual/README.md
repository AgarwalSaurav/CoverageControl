The library provides a simulation environment, algorithms, and PyTorch models for the coverage control problem.  
Key features:  
- The core library `CoverageControlCore` is written in C++ and CUDA for fast computation.
- There are `python` bindings that interface with the core library.
- Several algorithms are implemented for comparison and baselines.
- PyTorch models are available in both `C++` and `python`

# We use the function StepDataGenerationLocal to drive the robots around in the world
# The CoverageSystem maintains an oracle_map_ which has the information of the world_idf_ at the locations visited by any of the robots. For locations that haven't been visited yet, the importance is set to a Parameters::pUnknownImportance
# The StepDataGenerationLocal uses an Oracle which decides where the robots should move based on the oracle_map_ described above. It performs a Voronoi Tessalation will ALL the robots, then computes the centroid, solves the assignment problem, and then steps the robots towards their respective assigned centroids.
# The difference from standard methods is that this Oracle does not assume that the entire map is known. It uses only the information that is make available by the robots.
# The StepDataGenerationLocal function has an input num_steps. This allows us to step several times before exchanging data in order to get sufficiently varying data.
# Thus we can simulate several times on the same environment to get different dataset.
# For the training of the CNN, each robot is a unique data
# For each environment, lets say we can simulate upto pEpisodeSteps=1000, as after that the robots might either converge or just osscilate and no new data is generated.
# So for an environment, we take num_steps=10 for pEpisodeSteps/num_steps times. So we will end up with a dataset of num_robots * pEpisodeSteps/num_steps unique data
